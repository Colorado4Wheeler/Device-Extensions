Device Extensions
==========

A plugin for the Indigo home automation system (http://indigodomo.com)

Device Extension is a collection of devices that provide your existing devices with some extra features.  Like many of my plugins it was based on making my control pages easier to use and more intuitive, as well as eliminating a bunch of extra action groups and variables.  For example, your thermostat likely doesn't have a daily high and daily low saved state, by adding a "Thermostat Extension" and linking it to your existing thermostat it will now track those.
